Dynamic control of a bionic arm through Python scripting, effectively translating human hand movements into digital signals for robotic response.

Developed an interface between the gesture recognition system and an Arduino-controlled robotic arm, enabling precise mirroring of human hand movements.

Configured and calibrated servo motors on the bionic arm using PWM signals generated based on the hand's positional data to achieve fluid motion replication.
