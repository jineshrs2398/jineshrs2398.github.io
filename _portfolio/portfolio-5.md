Developed a 12DoF Dynamic Walking Robot in Matlab-Simulink, which can traverse through a flat plane.

Implemented Footstep planning and generated Zero moment points from the reference path and current
position. Inverse Kinematics is applied to actuate to the desired position for the corresponding joints.
