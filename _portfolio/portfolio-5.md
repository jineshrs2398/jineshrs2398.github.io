A bio-inspired solution for foot rehabilitation of stroke patients suffering from temporary paralysis.

Constructed a pneumatic circuit with solenoid valves for movement and pressure control of the actuators

Obtained Electromyographic signals from muscles for dorsiflexion and plantarflexion movement of the
foot from calf muscles.
