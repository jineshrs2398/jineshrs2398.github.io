Welcome to my website, where I showcase my expertise in robotics engineering and computer vision. With a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and a Master's degree in Robotics Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, I have honed my skills in deep learning and robotics.

In my professional experience, I have worked as a Research Assistant at WPI, where I developed RGB-guided LiDAR point cloud completion using a CNN. I have also worked as a Software Engineer at HTIC, where I built a graphical user interface for the 6-DOF Image-guided Surgical Robot using PyQT. Additionally, I have experience working on designing a wearable device to monitor the gait movement of older adults at IIT Madras.
