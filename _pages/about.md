Welcome to my website! As a passionate Robotics Engineer, I thrive on creating intelligent and dynamic machines that can interact and adapt to their environment. I hold an M.S. in Robotics Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute and a B.Tech. in Electrical & Electronics Engineering from the National Institute of Technology. During my education, I have gained expertise in various fields, including Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Robotics. I am skilled in programming languages such as Python, C/C++, Embedded C, MATLAB, and LaTeX. I have experience working with frameworks and packages like ROS, PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Git, and PyQT.

In my professional experience, I have worked as a Research Assistant at WPI, where I developed RGB-guided LiDAR point cloud completion using a CNN. I have also worked as a Software Engineer at HTIC, where I built a graphical user interface for the 6-DOF Image-guided Surgical Robot using PyQT. Additionally, I have experience working on a 12DoF Dynamic Walking Robot at IIIT Hyderabad and designing a wearable device to monitor the gait movement of older adults at IIT Madras.

My passion for Robotics extends beyond my professional experience, and I have worked on several projects, including implementing Deep Q Learning on a Racetrack environment, simulating self-driving cars, and developing a bio-inspired solution for foot rehabilitation of stroke with temporary foot paralysis.

I am committed to utilizing my skills and knowledge to make significant contributions to the field of Robotics, and I am excited about what the future holds in this ever-evolving field.
